==============

An [Alfred][alfred] workflow for showing weather forecasts

This workflow lets you access weather forecasts from [forecast.io][fio] and the
[Weather Underground][wund].

The package includes a number of icon sets from the Weather Underground and
from [weathericonsets.com][icons] (I'm not up to drawing weather icons yet).
Each set includes an `info.json` file that gives a short description and
provides a source URL for the icon set.
